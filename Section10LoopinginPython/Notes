#In python for loops are written like this:

for item in iterable_object:
    #do something with object


Key words for and in do not change

An iterable object is some kind of collection of items, for instance: a list of numbers, string of characters,
    a range, ect

item is a new variable that can be called whatever you want

item references the current position of our iterator within the iterable. It will iterate over (run through) every item
    of the collection and then go away when it visted all items
