Reading Files
    - you can read a file with the open function
    - open returns a file object to you
    - you can read a file object with the read method


   Open returns a file object

   Cursor Movement
    -Python reads files by using a cursor
    - This cursor is like what you use while your typing
    - After file is read, the cursor is at the end
    - to move the cursor, use the seek method

Closing a file
    - You can close a file with the close method
    - You can check if a file is closed with the closed attribute
    - Once closed, a file can't be read again




Wiritng Files

    - You have to use the open function to write to files
    - Need to specify the "w" flag as the second argument (default is"r" for reading")


Mods for Opening Files
    - r - read a file (no writing) - this is default
    - w - Write to a file (previous content removed)
    - a - append to a file (previous contents no removed)
        - append will always to the end, no matter what.
    - r+ - Read and write to a file (writing based on cursor)
