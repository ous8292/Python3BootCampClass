Notes


Inheritance
    A key feature of OOP is the ability to define a class which inherits from another class (a "base" or "parent" class).



Properties
    _propertyname, this signifies that it should only be used within this class
    - using _propertyname signifies that it is a private for this class


__init__ method
"__init__" is a reseved method in python classes.
It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology.
This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class


The word 'self' is used to represent the instance of a class.

The constructor is a method that is called when an object is created
     This method is defined in the class and can be used to initialize basic variables
      If you create four objects, the class constructor is called four times




Method Resolution Order (MRO)

Whenever you create a class, Python sets a Method Resolution Order, or MRO, for that class, which is the order in which Python will look for methods on instances of that class




Polymorphism

    a Key principle in OOP is the idea of polymorphism - an object can take on on many forms

    while formal definition of prolmorphism is difficult, here are two important practical applications:
        1: The same class method works in similar way for different classes
        2: Same operation works for different kinds of objects
